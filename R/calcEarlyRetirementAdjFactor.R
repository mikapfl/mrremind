#' @title calc Early Retirement Adjustment Factor
#' @description provides the extra retirement rate to account for relatively old fleet technologies retirement
#' @param subtype Some scenarios may require certain regions to increase retirement rate, e.g. PPCA coal phase-out
#' @return magpie object of additional adjusment percentage to be added to the fraction of the early retired capital in countries to account for relatively old technologies fleet

  ### SB 09.2020
  ### Increasing China's maximum retirement rate to match the EU and US (13%)
  ### China's weighted average plant lifespan was half the global average for plants retired in 2015-2020, due to technology efficiency upgrades,
  ### overcapacity (ongoing), and mismatched local and national political agendas. Plants are permitted by local authorities but can be retired by
  ### federal authorities. We expect the trend to continue to some degree because of the CPC's recent climate commitments and their political longevity.

  ### SB 12.2020
  ### Also increasing REF's retirement rate to match EU and US since they have an even older coal fleet
