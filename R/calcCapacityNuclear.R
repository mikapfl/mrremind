 ### overall philosophy:
  ## currently under construction goes online over the 5-year long 2020 timestep
  ## 90% of planned and 60% of proposed plants can come online in 2025 or 2030 timestep
  ## this corresponds well with maximum to be expected capacities for India and China
  ## China target 120-150 GW in 2030 (https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL3N16M3QX)
  ## India 63 GW in 2032 (though pre-Fukushima) (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-eyeing-63000-mw-nuclear-power-capacity-by-2032-npcil/articleshow/6730724.cms)
